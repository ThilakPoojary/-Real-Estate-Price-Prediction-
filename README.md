# 🏠 Real Estate Price Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict real estate property prices based on input features such as location, total square footage, number of bedrooms (BHK), and number of bathrooms. The goal is to help buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals make informed pricing decisions.
